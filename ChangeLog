1.0 - Initial Release

1.1 - Customizablity Update
 - created seperate files for the user functions allowing easier updating for users
   - this way they don't have to rewrite their switch statments everytime there is an update
 - additional versions of the arduino code to support different arduino types (now supports Yun, Wifi, and Ethernet)
   - note: because I do not own a Wifi or Ethernet shield those codes are not properly tested please let me know if you have issues

1.2 - Natural Language Update
 - now the session will remain open (so you don't have to say "Alexa tell home logistics" before every command)
 - improved some of the responces to feel more natural
